A little story:
I was born on the East Coast of the United States, in the State of New Jersey (The Garden State), the first-born son of German immigrants, my mother a nurse, and later, a restaurateur and my father, a machinist and later, a nuclear technician. I grew up as most immigrant children do, living in two worlds while making my way through life, and it has always given me a unique perspective, that ironically, I share with so many of our team membersâ€”we are all unique, yet all one family.
